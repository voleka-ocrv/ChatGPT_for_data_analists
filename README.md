# ChatGPT for data analists

ChatGPT is the future that is already here. There is no question of using this tool. The question now is how you can get most from that, delegate routine tasks, and increase your performance.

For a complex task, it is better to set context at first:
- Assign a role
- Give context
- Provide a data example

ChatGPT can write code to solve the task. 
You may get an error, when you will run the code. Ask ChatGPT to help with that.

To get a better result:
- Be specific
- Set  context
- Do not hesitate to repeat
